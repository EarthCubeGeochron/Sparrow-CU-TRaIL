# Notes for working remotely (Daven Quinn, 10-2022)

Once you generate a publication table with the `sparrow run export-table --name <name>` command,
you can download it without using Google Drive using `scp trailsparrow:/projects/Sparrow-gdrive/Sparrow_data/ExportPublicationTable/test.xlsx test.xlsx`.

We might want to make a way to get a temporary/sharable download link to the file as well...this will help with eventual exporting.
