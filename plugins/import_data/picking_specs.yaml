# First we define metadata necessary to perform data reduction for a given grain
Metadata:
  Sample: Sample.1 # the .1 is because this is actually the second column called "Sample"
  Grain: Aliquot             (label a01, a02, z01, z02, etc.)
  Researcher: Analyst
  Fragment: Shard (Y or N)?
  Mineral: 'Mineral (a, z, t, or m)'
  Crystal terminations: Np (0,1, or 2)
  Crystal geometry: Geometry (1,2,3, or 4, see chart)
  Date: Date Packed
  Dimensions: # Need to explicitly define 
    Length 1: L1
    Width 1: W1
    Length 2: L2
    Width 2: W2
# Next, define the columns in the picking sheet. These are split into two categories: Shape and Characteristics
# In each category, we record data (hard numbers), and attributes (descriptors).
# For attributes, first give the column name and then the label to put in sparrow, e.g., "- Surface Color or Staining: Surface color/staining"
# For data, we need to record the column name first and the give the name to put in sparrow as well as the unit, following the convention below
# Since data are more complicated and don't appear any different on the front end, we only use data when units are necessary
# Also note, the results should appear in the front end in the same order they're listed here
Shape:
  data:
    - L1:
        name: Length 1
        unit: "\u03bcm"
    - W1:
        name: Width 1
        unit: "\u03bcm"
    - L2:
        name: Length 2
        unit: "\u03bcm"
    - W2:
        name: Width 2
        unit: "\u03bcm"
  attributes:
    - Geometry (1,2,3, or 4, see chart): Geometry
    - Np (0,1, or 2): Crystal terminations
Characteristics:
  attributes:
    - Color (apatite) or Clarity (zircon): Color
    - Surface Color or Staining: Surface color/staining
    - Surface Roughness (GEM chart): Roughness (1-3)
    - Idealness of xtal form (GEM chart): Idealness of Crystal (A-C)
    - Mineral Inclusions? (should be avoided for apatite, see notes for zircons): Mineral inclusions
    - Fluid Inclusions? (should be avoided for all grains): Fluid inclusions
    - Additional descriptive notes: Notes
